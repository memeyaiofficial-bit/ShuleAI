The big elephant, Tembo, declared that only the strongest animals could drink first. The smaller animals like rabbits, squirrels, and birds had to wait. Kipchoge thought this was unfair. He came up with a brilliant plan. He told Tembo that he knew of a bigger, cleaner water hole just beyond the hill, but only brave animals could find it. Tembo, wanting to prove his bravery, followed Kipchoge. While Tembo searched for the imaginary water hole, all the small animals drank peacefully. When Tembo returned, Kipchoge explained that sharing water was more important than showing strength.",

Every morning, Amina helped water the plants and remove weeds. One day, her grandmother fell ill and couldn't tend to the garden. Amina was worried the vegetables would die. She remembered everything her grandmother had taught her: water in the early morning, remove weeds carefully, and always talk sweetly to the plants. For two weeks, Amina cared for the garden alone.

His teacher, Mr. Kiprotich, believed he had a good chance of winning. On the day of the competition, Mwangi felt nervous when he saw students from other schools. Some looked very confident, and others carried thick mathematics books. When the competition began, Mwangi realized that many questions were similar to the ones he had practiced. He solved them carefully, checking each answer twice. However, there was one very difficult question that stumped everyone. Mwangi thought about it differently, using a method his grandfather had taught him for counting cattle. To everyone's surprise, he got it right!

Inside was a yellowed piece of paper with strange symbols and drawings of palm trees, wells, and ancient buildings. 'This looks like a treasure map!' exclaimed Maina. Their uncle explained that their great-grandfather was a famous trader who traveled along the East African coast. The map showed locations where he had buried valuable items for safekeeping. The children studied the map carefully. They recognized the landmarks - the old fort, the baobab tree by the well, and the ancient mosque. Following the map, they discovered not gold or silver, but something more precious: old family photographs, letters, and traditional jewelry that told the story of their ancestors.",

The ceremony lasted three days. People sang traditional songs, danced ancient dances, and the elders offered prayers to their ancestors. Young Wanjiku participated with her family, learning the old ways for the first time. On the third night, dark clouds gathered in the sky. Lightning flashed, thunder roared, and finally, the rains came! The village celebrated as the life-giving water soaked the earth.
